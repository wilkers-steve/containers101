In order to help individuals get up to speed with a basic understanding
of containers and related technology, I've gathered my favorite list of
posts/materials

1) https://puppet.com/resources/ebook/containers-101

   This 'free' ebook from Puppet gives a high level view of the concepts
   related to containers. I've always been a Puppet fan, and some of their
   points here are valid and can help give a better view of the bigger
   picture.

2) https://prakhar.me/docker-curriculum/

   This tutorial helped me get up to speed with Docker, and it allows you
   an opportunity to get your hands dirty with some easy Docker commands
   that still give you an idea of the important bits. I feel this post is a
   great springboard for diving deeper into Docker. It includes an easy to
   follow example with a web service application on AWS.

3) https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted/

   The Docker getting started guide is a great next step for those looking
   to explore deeper into the concepts talked about in Prakhar's getting
   started tutorial. I found this walk-through to be very valuable.

4) https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/

   This guide gives you an opportunity to play with Docker Compose. I
   feel getting some experience with Docker Compose is great before trying
   to tackle an orchestration platform, like Kubernetes

5) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ht22ReBjno

   This video does a stellar job at explaining the concepts behind Kubernetes
   in a way that is both meaningful and easy to digest. I feel this video is
   the best springboard for jumping into Kubernetes fresh.

6) https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube

   Minikube is the go-to platform for developers to use in Kubernetes development.
   It's lightweight, simple, and still gives you experience with the fundamentals.

7) https://www.udacity.com/course/scalable-microservices-with-kubernetes--ud615

   This free Udacity course is fantastic. It gives an understanding of the concepts
   of Kubernetes without being overly intidimating. This is by far one of my favorite
   links for those looking to get started, and bonus: it's Kelsey Hightower.
